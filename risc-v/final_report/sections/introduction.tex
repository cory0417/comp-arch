\section{Introduction}

From the previous mini project, I have implemented a RISC-V core that can execute a simple program. Thus, in this project, I wanted to extend the functionality of the core by adding a UART peripheral that can be used to load programs into the memory for execution. The envisioned steps were as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item User sends a program to the FPGA via physical UART connection.
    \item FPGA stores the program in a dedicated FIFO.
    \item When the FIFO reaches the maximum capacity (512 bytes), the core is held in reset until the FIFO is transferred to the instruction memory.
    \item The core is released from reset when the FIFO is empty.
    \item The core then executes the program.
\end{enumerate}
